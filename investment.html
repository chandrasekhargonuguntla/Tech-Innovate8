            <h2>Crowdfunding</h2>
            <p>Crowdfunding is a way of raising money to finance projects and businesses. It enables fundraisers to 
                collect money from a large number of people via online platforms. Crowdfunding is most often used 
                by startup companies or growing businesses as a way of accessing alternative funds.
            </p><br>
           <P> Crowdfunding is a way to raise money for an individual or organization by collecting donations through family,
             friends, friends of friends, strangers, businesses, and more.  By using social media, people can reach more
              potential donors than traditional forms of fundraising.</P><br>
              <p>Crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range of for-profit entrepreneurial ventures such as 
                artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, and community-oriented social e
                ntrepreneurship projects. Although crowdfunding has been suggested to be highly linked to 
                sustainability, empirical validation has shown that sustainability plays only a fractional role 
                in crowdfunding. Its use has also been criticized for funding quackery, especially costly and
                 fraudulent cancer treatments.
